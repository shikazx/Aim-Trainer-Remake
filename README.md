Welcome to my Aim Trainer! A small remake of my first ever CS project from Grade 11 :)

## Game Features
- Menu Screen
- Options screen to change reticles (has a senjougahara reticle)
- In-Game timer
- Results screen which displays performance statistics
- funny music

## Stuffs used
I used pygame to create the whole thing, and MSPaint/Pixlr for the assets.

## I want to play the game!
1. Download all Python files, image files, and music files. Make sure to keep them in the right directory like how the repo is set up.

2. Download [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

3. Run the 'gameLoop.py' file.

4. HAVE FUN!
