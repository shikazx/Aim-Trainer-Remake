# Aim Trainer Remake :D

Welcome to my Aim Trainer! A small remake of my first ever CS project from Grade 11 :)

## Stuffs used

I used pygame to create the whole thing, and MSPaint/Pixlr for the assets.

## I want to play the game!

1. Download all Python files, image files, and music files.

2. Download [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

3. Run the 'gameLoop.py' file.

4. HAVE FUN!
